# Time-series analysis: A Primer
---

---

## Introduction

This is a very basic introduction into applied time-series using R, based on material coming from "Forecasting & time-series: An applied approach" by Bowerman & O'Connell. Topics that will be covered among others are: simple linear regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, etc, while using R. 

## Time-series

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
